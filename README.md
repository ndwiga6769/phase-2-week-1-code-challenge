# TRANSACTION RECORDS

## DESCRIPTION
The following app  will contain the following functionalities
-The component called TransactionTable displays a table of all 
transactions. This component should receive an array of transactions
as a prop and render each transaction as a row in the table. 
- The component called TransactionForm allows the user to add a new 
  transaction. This component has a form with input fields for the date,
   description, category, and amount of the transaction. When the user 
   submits the form, the component should create a new transaction object 
   and add it to the array of transactions passed in as a prop. 
-The component called SearchBar  allows the user to filter transactions
 by typing into a search bar. This component receives a callback function
  as a prop that will be called with the search term entered by the user.
